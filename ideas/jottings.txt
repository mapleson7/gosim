I need to make a state machine on the front end to sort out where we are in the program.

Based on the user logged in, there will always be a Your Stable section. Which will have your horses. Your horses are saved in a back end database with al lthe required stats attached to itself. 

Finances section which will be a desk.

Training

Vet/Medical and  (Level or hire a person at a certain level with certain stats)

Farrier (Level)

You can have an overview of all your horses, which will be the view of your stable.

I need a way to connect to the database from the frontend. 
This will be through an exposed API. 

You log in. And are authenticated from the database. 
Which will then will default when you click on the frontend your stable. 
The frontend fetch call to the api endpoint wil be tailored to your own username. 
The logic on the backend then will do a search of all horses which are owned just by you.

I can do an initial fetch call now which wil just get all horses. 

I need to learn:
1. How do send GET and POST requests through the Fetch API with my Javascript front end code, and attach that to buttons?
2. How do I search the database with my GORM on the backend and return the horses?
