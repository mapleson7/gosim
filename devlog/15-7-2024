Current Goal:
What i want to do is fill the local database with Source Horses.
These are the horses which all Starter Horses are born from.
I need them on the database as they will provide the gene pool for starter horses to breed with.

I should write a function which will populate the DB with source horses.
This function will create the source horses with random stats.
