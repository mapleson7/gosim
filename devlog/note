i need to start off the day with some goal.

I think i should work on the backend.

i dont have toi have a frntend yet to represent it.

But what i want to acheive is this:

I want to have 10 users in the db, each with their 5 starter horses.

all bred from the source horses I have.

Then I can update the source horses frontend page to dispaly the actual info i want dispalyed for them -- Progeny eg.

In order to do this i need:

User models Y

Create a CreateStarterHorse fucntion
this func should create a new horse, based on a random dams breeding with source horses and there foals breeding.

--

1. We will need to select 4 different source horses at random out of all of them.

2. Create a random Mare#1

3. breed SourceHorse#1 with Mare#1 which creates Mare#2

4. breed SourceHorse#2 with Mare#2 which creates Mare#3

5. breed SourceHorse#3 with Mare#3 which creates Mare#4

6. breed SourceHorse#4 with Mare#4 which creates StarterHorse of Either Sex.
